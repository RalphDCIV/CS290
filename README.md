Reddit - Simple design that makes finding info realy easy when trying to find information about somthing i'm looking for. https://www.reddit.com/ 
  The site has a lot of empty space on the pc version. 

Wikipedia - well orginized and and uniform throughout the website making it easy to find what your looking for. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XII_of_Sweden
  I don't really have any ideas on how to improve it

Youtube - Its easy to search and find the video's i'm looking for and has nice features like replyaing a video to mae it easier to lisetn to songs. https://www.youtube.com/
  Youtube likes to make changes to the site constantly which can make it confusing to find where they moved certain fetures or features they may have added or removed.

Steam - dropdowns and sidebars make it easy to narrow in on a game you like without much issue. https://store.steampowered.com/
  not being able to browse all the genres by hiting browse by genre and instaed bing limitede to the one listed there unless going through the actual search.

Amazon fits a lot of information on a single page in a way that doesnt feel overly cluttered. https://www.amazon.com/
  The constant "deals" (ads) for things i dont need and will never use is annoying.
